Comparative Sales Analysis Dashboard 
This dashboard tracks key metrics such as current year (CY) sales, previous year (PY) sales, budgeted sales, and year-over-year (YOY) sales growth. 
The dashboard helps stakeholders compare the sales performance across different categories and months, providing insights into the companyâ€™s financial health and sales efficiency.

Analytical Methods:
I used DAX expressions to compute key metrics such as YOY growth percentage and budget variance. Additionally, conditional formatting was applied to highlight categories performing above or below the budget, offering a quick visual cue for decision-makers.

Challenges & Solutions:
A challenge was dealing with inconsistent time-series data across different categories and products. To resolve this, I implemented time intelligence functions in Power BI to standardize the dates and create accurate time-based comparisons.
