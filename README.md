Comparative Sales Analysis Dashboard 
This dashboard tracks key metrics such as current year (CY) sales, previous year (PY) sales, budgeted sales, and year-over-year (YOY) sales growth. 
The dashboard helps stakeholders compare the sales performance across different categories and months, providing insights into the company’s financial health and sales efficiency.

Data Source & Preparation:
The data was sourced from the company’s internal sales records and budget reports. I used Power BI’s Query Editor to clean and transform the raw data, ensuring consistency in the data formats and removing any discrepancies. The preparation involved creating relationships between sales figures across multiple years to enable accurate comparisons.
